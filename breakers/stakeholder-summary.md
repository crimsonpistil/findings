## Disclosure

We discovered that The Breakers’ website was compromised by attackers. Malicious code was added directly into the site so that some visitors were redirected to a fake “Cloudflare security check” page. That page tried to trick people into running a dangerous command on their computer, which could have led to malware infections.

In addition, attackers created fake blog posts on the site about casinos and gambling. These weren’t meant for your customers, but to make the site show up in Google searches and attract more visitors who might click the malicious links. This means the site was being abused to spread harmful software.

We also found that real staff accounts (including Barbara Martens and Ethan Whited) exist on the site, and the generic “admin” account is still active. These accounts may have been targeted to gain access.

What this means for you:

- Your site was being used by criminals to push malware, not just to deface it.
- Visitors could have been put at risk.
- Staff accounts and passwords may also have been targeted.

Next steps we recommend:

- Immediately reset all staff website passwords and remove the old admin account.
- Remove the malicious code and casino blog posts.
- Update the website software and plugins to close any holes the attackers used.
- Turn on stronger protections like two-factor authentication and monitoring.
