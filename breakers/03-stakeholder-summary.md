## Website Security Incident – Executive Summary
The Breakers FWB website was recently compromised through a sophisticated ClickFix-based attack, transforming it into a malware distribution platform. This incident presents serious risks to visitor safety, staff credentials, and the organization’s digital reputation.

## Key Findings
- ClickFix Exploit Chain: Attackers injected malicious JavaScript that triggered a fake Cloudflare “verification” page. This page exploited the ClickFix technique to silently execute a full PowerShell attack chain, potentially delivering malware without user awareness.
- Search Engine Poisoning: Spam blog posts promoting casinos and gambling were published to manipulate SEO rankings and funnel traffic to the compromised site.
- Compromised Accounts: Active staff accounts—including Barbara Martens and Ethan Whited—were found on the site, alongside the default “admin” account. These may have been leveraged to maintain persistence or publish malicious content.

## Why This Matters
- The site was weaponized to deliver malware, not merely defaced.
- Visitors may have unknowingly triggered PowerShell payloads via the ClickFix mechanism.
- Staff credentials could be compromised, enabling future re-entry by attackers.
- The site’s SEO presence was hijacked to attract and infect unsuspecting users.

## Recommended Actions
- Reset all staff passwords immediately, including Barbara and Ethan’s. Permanently disable the generic “admin” account.
- Remove all injected code and spam content, especially casino-related posts.
- Update WordPress core, themes, and plugins to patch known vulnerabilities.
- Enable stronger security controls, including two-factor authentication and activity monitoring.
- Conduct a full audit of user activity and file changes to detect lingering threats.
- Implement ongoing monitoring and hardening
