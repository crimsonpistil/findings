## IR Journal
This repo serves as a collection of my research, findings, and notes from various security investigations and incident response activities.  
It serves as a central place to organize artifacts, reports, and indicators of compromise (IOCs).

## Contents
- **Reports** – Incident response write-ups and summaries.  
- **Notes** – Scratch files, tool outputs, and analysis artifacts (e.g., `nmap`, `nikto`, `wpscan`, `curl` results).  
- **IOCs** – Domains, IPs, file hashes, and other indicators collected during investigations.  
- **Screenshots** – Visual evidence captured during analysis.  

## Disclaimer
This repository is for **documentation and research purposes only**.  
It may contain references to malicious domains, IP addresses, or payloads observed during analysis.  
Do **not** interact with these IOCs outside of a controlled and isolated environment.  
*This repo is for my personal findings and notes across different investigations. It is not tied to any single organization or case.*
